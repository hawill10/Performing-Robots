## Idea
### Appearance
![initial sketch](./images/sketch.jpg)
I want to build a robot that moves around looking for an object. Its appearance is very roughly (sorry, my drawing is really bad) shown in the image above. It's basically a box with neo-pixel on the front that moves on wheels. It also has a spinning stick on the top that is supposed to mimic a radar. The goal for this project would be to build this box as sturdy as possible since it's usually fragility of mechanical parts that prevent me to go further. So, I would like to first make it hard and simple. 
### Performance
![performance route](./images/performance_routes.jpg)
Since the mission of the robot (I'll assume it's a he/him for now) is to find an object (I'm thinking about a cute doll), the performance starts with the robot looking for the object. Although the object is right behind him, he does not recognize it because he can only sense what's in front of himself. So, he moves around looking for the object until he draws a circle and comes back to the original spot facing the object. The route is as depicted in the image above.
### Expression
Neo-pixel and movement are the two ways I will use to make him expressive. When he is yet to find the object and still searching for it, the number of lights lit on the neo-pixel would be small or even 1 and the change of lighted pixels would be slow. The movement of the robot would also be slow, all of the signs intended to convey how careful and vigilant he is. Finally when he finds the object, he expresses joy with colorful and chaotic pattern of neo-pixel and also fast and jittery movement.
