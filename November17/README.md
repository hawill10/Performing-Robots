Thoughts/Questions from the reading
1. Even if you practice tens of thousands of hours on a specific performance, it is impossible for humans to perform the exactly same for repeated performaces. This imperfection is what makes a single performance more valuable and touching. Robots, on the other hand, can repeat the same movement over and over again. The reading mentions how this perfection can rather diminish the experience of watching digital puppet performance. Why do we feel more attached and intrigued by human imperfection.
2. I have never thought of video as a means to display characters in a performance. What is a benefit of using videos to depict two different spaces on one stage instead of using tow separeted sets, etc?
3. The author talks a lot about how differences between human and non-human actors make performance with non-humans more interesting. As of now, this is true because robots are not like us. However, as technology advances, it is likely that, some time in the future, robots could be hard to distinguish from humans especially in a controlled setting like performances. What would be the meaning of robot actors in that future?
