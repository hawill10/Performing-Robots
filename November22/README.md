## Idea for dwarf

1. Discovering Snow white at home
Each dwarf takes the stage and talks about what to do about her.
- Angry wants to kick her out of the house (Angry Neopixel)
- Happy is happy to have a new friend
- Love falls in love with her
- Indecisive cannot decide

The scene establishes the personality of each character.

2. Snow white and the dwarves have a good time
Snow white calls the dwarves to charge
Dwarves communicate using pitches between themselves.
- Angry complains but does what she tells it to do
- Happy joyfully comes to charge
- Love is embarrassed and comes slowly
- Indecisive still cannot decide

3. Snow white found dead
All of them weep. They all are sad. Some kind of ceremony.
- They circle around snow white and voices certain pitch, creating a sad harmony.

4. Spot appears and wakes snow white up
- They are all joyful
- each dwarf shows its dance
