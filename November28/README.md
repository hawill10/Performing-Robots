Interesting idea about the feedback loop between human and machine. Do we imitate machines or do machines imitate us. What is the relationship between human and machine? If machines are meant to do efficient work that humans are not supposed to do, should it make people happier or better than before? If not, what good does efficiency do? It seems like obsession with efficiency derived from machines are being applied to humans as well, making humans less content with life. This could be thought of as an enslavement of human by machines. But, it is also true that machines enable things that cannot be done solely by humnas. Computers enabled so many things that weren't possible in the past. It would be the balance between the two that will make technology and machines beneficial for humans.
It is also interesting to think about a reality where human and robots are the same. What does the narrowing gap mean for us?
