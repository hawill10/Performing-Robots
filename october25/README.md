I would like to recreate a scene from Byuljooboo-jeon, a Korean traditional play. It is a story of a turtle who is sent on a mission to bring a rabbit's liver as a cure for Yongwang's (king of the sea) illness. The turtle deceives the rabbit and brings it to the sea palace. Here comes the scene I would like to recreate. The rabbit tells Yongwang that it can take out a liver and put it back in and that it had hidden its liver back home. 
Since I lack building skills, I would like to make the robots in simple forms, like a square or triangular box. The sea creatures and land creatures will have different forms in order to distinguish them. I would like to make use of neo-pixel as a mean to express concrete messages. In order to express nervousness of the rabbit, the rabbit's movements would be jittery. No straight movements but quickly going back and forth. Yongwang, the most powerful character of the play, will move slowly and use big motions.
